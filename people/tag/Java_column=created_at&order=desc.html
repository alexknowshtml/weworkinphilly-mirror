Trailblazer.

Transformer of ideas into action. 

Regardless of the task at hand, I am more than happy to jump in and learn as I go. In the past five years I've created a training practice at Chariot Solutions, hosted a long running podcast, the Chariot TechCast, authored Spring Roo in Action (Manning publications), and have been responsible for the recording, producing and hosting of screencasts of more than 50 presentations. 

My first love is teaching, and so in that capacity I am a mentor and trainer. I enjoy presenting at user groups, conferences, and online. I've run webinars and online training as well as leading custom training both onsite and at our training facility.

I am also an application developer and architect with experience in many different technologies. I have onsite consulting and development experience with Java, Groovy, the Spring Framework, Maven, and various other application frameworks and languages. I can work within agile development practices, help with implementing repeatable builds with Maven or rolling out continuous integration using tools such as Jenkins. I have a background in database design. 

I am a team player and am always willing to collaborate to make the group better.

I host podcasts and screencasts for Chariot at http://emergingtech.chariotsolutions.com and I am co-chair of the Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise conference, located at http://phillyemergingtech.com
