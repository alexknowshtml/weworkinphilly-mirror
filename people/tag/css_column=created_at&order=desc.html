</h3>
<p class='bio'>Chris Vasquez joined Poptent in late 2008 to help create the initial user interfaces and experiences. Now, in his role leading Product, he focuses on identifying problems facing Poptent clients in their efforts to find, activate, and manage creative talent, developing solutions to those problems, and packaging them in a platform built on simple and enjoyable interactions.

He’s a firm believer in the idea that open, unbiased curiosity is the foundation of good product development. This philosophy led him to co-found Poptent’s internal think tank, Poptent Labs, out of which emerged a number of the company’s most innovative products and client engagement strategies including Poptent’s consumer testing product as well as development of products focused on influencer marketing and micro-content for Vine and Instagram.

Chris got his start running a boutique web development shop in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley, helping a range of companies with projects spanning the spectrum from browser based email signature injections to support charitable donations, to promotional sites for major motion pictures. A futurist to the core, Chris’ life is a never ending investigation into what the world will be like next year and how to best prepare for it.

When not working, Chris researches social and emotional triggers by watching videos of cats jumping into things.</p>
